# Energy Pricing Analytics

A real-time stream processsing engine that provides pricing analytics for energy consumption by capturing tariff-switching events.

Downstream services and end users: This project represents a foundational layer of a large-scale pricing infrastructure that can power key use-cases like dynamic pricing, demand elasticity modeling, and A/B test measurement.

### Tech

* Apache Kafka: Event streaming (with sample data) for real-time ingestion
* Python: Event producers and consumers for event processing & metric aggregation
* PostgreSQL: Database for storing raw user events and hourly aggregated business metrics
* Prometheus: Monitoring, alerts, and logging metrics for Kafka (producer and consumer) and application health
* Grafana: Observability dashboards and BI visualizations
* Docker & docker-compose: Containerized development and orchestration
* Pytest: Unit test suite for event producer and consumer

### Observability Dashboards

* System Health Monitoring & Metrics (eg. Number of processed events, failed db writes etc.)

## Execution

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10, Pytest
* Docker and Docker Compose

1. Setup:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd energy-data-stream-processing

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run tests:

6 tests pass in each-
```bash
PYTHONPATH=producer pytest -sv tests/test_producer.py

PYTHONPATH=consumer pytest -sv tests/test_consumer.py
```

3. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Dashboards:

*	Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
*	Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (Default login: `admin/admin`, and then skip password change)
  * Energy Business Metrics: http://localhost:3000/d/energy-business-metrics/energy-business-metrics
  * Kafka & DB Metrics: http://localhost:3000/d/data-ops-dashboard/kafka-and-db-metrics

### Design Considerations
* One Kafka topic for all user-energy events (at prototype level)
* Consumer handles event processing, metric aggregation, and flushing to database
  * With a single-thread processor (at prototype level)
* Aggregation = hourly by event type

### Data sources

**Event Types**

* user_login: Customer authentication events
* view_tariffs: Tariff browsing behavior 
* tariff_switch: Tariff change events with revenue impact 
* energy_consumed: Energy consumption measurements 
* incentive_claim: Green energy incentive claims
* bill_payment: Payment processing events

### Data Models: Tables and views

* `events`: Raw event data with customer, channel, and business context
* `hourly_business_metrics`: Aggregated business KPIs by hour
* `customer_view`: Customer profile and segmentation data
* `rolling_24h_metrics`: view
* `daily_event_summary`: view

```
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U user -d events_db
[user: password]

\d

select * from ...;
```

### Troubleshooting

**Check running containers and logs**
```bash
docker ps -a
docker-compose logs [container]
```

**Notes**

* Wait for a few seconds for the producer and consumer to start generating logs, from docker
* While the metrics dashboards are updated in real-time, a lag of few records is to be expected
* The BI dashboard is for representation purposes, and does not guarantee complete accuracy given the sample data provided


**Final Logs (Producer)**
```bash
producer-1    | 2025-06-10 03:15:24,679 [INFO] Sent: {'event_type': ..., 'payload': ...}
consumer-1    | 2025-06-10 03:15:24,683 [INFO] Listening to: {'event_type': ..., 'payload': ...}
producer-1    | 2025-06-10 03:15:25,377 [INFO] Finished sending events.
producer-1    | 2025-06-10 03:15:25,378 [INFO] Waiting for final metrics to be scraped...
producer-1 exited with code 0
consumer-1    | 2025-06-10 03:15:48,227 [INFO] Flushed metrics for 10 hours, cleaned up 10 old entries
```

### Future Enhancements
* Add CI workflows for linting, testing, and image validation (e.g., GitHub Actions)
* Introduce async architecture and Kafka schema registry to scale architecture
* Infrastructure-as-code and deployment workflows
* Improved validation with tools like pydantic
